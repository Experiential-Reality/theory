## Key Examples

### The Physics Traverser

The axioms that define physics as a BLD traverser. Key results:
- n = 4 dimensions (derived)
- 3 generations (from triality)
- SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) gauge structure

### Euler's Constants

How e and π emerge from BLD:
- **e**: Discrete exponential traversal
- **π**: Rotational closure (D×L = 2π closes B)

### Lie Algebras

Direct examples of the BLD = Lie theory correspondence.
