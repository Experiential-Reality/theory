## Key Derivations

| Quantity | Source | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| λ = 1/√20 | S₃ cascade × Catalan C₃ | DERIVED |
| M_P/v = λ⁻²⁶ | Scale hierarchy | DERIVED |
| Circuit optimization | 87.8% improvement | VALIDATED |

## The Scale Hierarchy

```
v (246 GeV) → M_P (1.22 × 10¹⁹ GeV)

M_P = v × λ⁻²⁶ × √(5/14) × (79/78) × (1 + 6/(n×L×B²))
```

Where λ = 1/√20 is derived from S₃ cascade structure.
