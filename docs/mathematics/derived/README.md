## The Structural Manifold

The derived results center on the **structural manifold** — a geometric space where:
- **Points** = BLD configurations (B, L, D)
- **Distance** = Alignment cost between structures
- **Geodesics** = Optimal transformation paths

This manifold:
- Contains classical Information Geometry as a submanifold
- Connects to Lie theory via symmetric space structure
- Enables prediction of system behavior from structure alone
