# Cyclic Cosmology: The Eternal Structure

## Summary

**Eternal structure (not temporal cycles):**

1. B exists: nothing is self-contradictory — [The Structure](#the-structure)
2. B partitions direction: +B (matter) and -B (antimatter) — [B Partitions Direction](#b-partitions-direction)
3. Connected by L=2: Killing form links partitions — [Eternal Relation](#the-eternal-relation)
4. Both sides compute: +B past→future, -B future→past — [Both Sides Compute](#both-sides-compute)
5. Junction agreement: "now" is where computations agree — [The Junction](#the-junction-is-now)
6. Time is perspective: Big Bang = +B view, not event — [Big Bang](#the-big-bang-and-heat-death)

| Concept | BLD Interpretation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Big Bang | +B side of traverse(-B, B) |
| Heat death | Perspective within +B |
| Arrow of time | L-direction within partition |
| Conservation | B, +B/-B, and L=2 persist eternally |

---

## The Claim

The universe does not "begin" or "end."

The universe IS the structure: `traverse(-B, B)` with constant L=2.

What we call "Big Bang" and "heat death" are perspectives on the same eternal structure.

---

## The Structure

### B Partitions Direction

From [Genesis Function](genesis-function.md):

```
B exists (nothing is impossible)
    ↓
B must partition (boundaries partition)
    ↓
Only direction available
    ↓
B partitions into +B and -B
    ↓
+B and -B must relate
    ↓
traverse(-B, B) requires L
    ↓
L = 2 (Killing form, constant)
```

### The Eternal Relation

The structure is:

```
-B <——L=2——> +B

Where:
  +B = our universe (matter, time-forward, left-handed)
  -B = anti-universe (antimatter, time-backward, right-handed)
  L  = 2 (constant connection, Killing form)
```

This is not a state that "arose." This IS existence.

### Both Sides Compute

From [Cosmic Computation](../quantum/cosmic-computation.md):

```
+B computes: past → present → future
-B computes: future → present → past

At every junction, both must agree via L.
```

---

## What "Cyclic" Means

### Not Temporal Cycles

The universe is not cyclic in the sense of:
- Big Bang → expansion → contraction → Big Bang
- One timeline looping back

### Structural Eternity

The universe is "cyclic" in the sense of:
- The structure `traverse(-B, B)` is self-sustaining
- +B and -B perpetually compute each other
- The junction consistency is eternal

```
It's not: Big Bang → heat death → Big Bang → ...
It's:     traverse(-B, B) = eternal structure
```

---

## The "Big Bang" and "Heat Death"

### From +B Perspective (Us)

Looking "backward" in time, we see:
- Structure becoming denser
- A "beginning" (Big Bang)

Looking "forward" in time, we see:
- Structure diluting
- An "end" (heat death)

### From -B Perspective

Looking in their "forward" direction (our backward):
- They see structure diluting toward their "heat death"

Looking in their "backward" direction (our forward):
- They see structure becoming denser, a "Big Bang"

### The Symmetry

```
What +B calls "Big Bang" is what -B calls approaching junction from their side
What +B calls "heat death" is what -B calls their "Big Bang" direction

Neither is privileged. Both are perspectives on traverse(-B, B).
```

---

## Time in the Structure

### Time is L-Direction

Time is not fundamental. Time is **L-direction** — which way you traverse the links.

```
+B: L flows past → future (our experience)
-B: L flows future → past (their experience)
```

### The Junction is "Now"

At the junction where +B and -B agree:
- This is the present moment
- Both computations describe the same state
- The future is constrained by this agreement

### No "Before" or "After"

There is no "before the Big Bang" because:
- The Big Bang is not an event in time
- The Big Bang IS the +B side of traverse(-B, B)
- Time is defined within +B, not outside it

---

## What Persists

### Not D, Not L-amount, But B

Within +B, matter (D) dilutes and geometry (L) stretches.

But:
- B (the distinction itself) persists
- The partition +B/-B persists
- The constant L=2 between them persists
- traverse(-B, B) persists

```
What changes: D and L within each partition
What persists: B, the partitions +B/-B, the constant L=2 between them
```

### The Eternal Present

From "outside" (if such a view were possible):

There is only the eternal structure traverse(-B, B).

The "flow of time" is our experience of being +B.

The "history of the universe" is the +B computation.

But the structure itself is not temporal. It simply IS.

## Comparison with Other Models

| Model | Mechanism | BLD Comparison |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Penrose CCC | Conformal rescaling | Different: no conformal tricks needed |
| Ekpyrotic | Brane collision | Different: no extra dimensions |
| Big Bounce | Quantum gravity | Different: no quantum gravity needed |
| Steady State | Continuous creation | Different: not creating in time |
| **BLD** | traverse(-B, B) eternal | Structure is existence itself |

### The BLD Insight

BLD doesn't say "the universe cycles through time."

BLD says "the universe IS the structure traverse(-B, B), which is eternal."

Time is not the arena. Time is the L-direction within +B.

## The Ring Traverses the Cloth Eternally

The [ring/cloth model](genesis-function.md#the-ring-and-cloth-model) provides a geometric picture of cyclic cosmology:

### Torus-Like Topology

The cloth (BL mesh created by traversal) has a **closed topology**:

```
        ╭─────────────────────────────────╮
        │                                 │
        │   ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   │
        │   ░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░   │
    ←───│   ░░░░░▓ RING  ▓░░░░░░░░░░░░   │───→
        │   ░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░   │
        │   ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   │
        │                                 │
        ╰─────────────────────────────────╯
              The cloth wraps around
```

The ring doesn't reach an "edge" and stop. The cloth's topology closes — the ring traverses eternally through the structure it creates.

### Why No Beginning or End

| Linear View | Ring/Cloth View |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Big Bang = beginning | Ring entering this region of cloth |
| Heat death = end | Ring moving to distant cloth region |
| Time passes | Ring traverses its own output |

From inside the ring (us), we see "past" and "future." But the ring has no before or after — it simply traverses. The cloth has no edge — it closes on itself.

### The Arrow of Time as Ring Direction

The arrow of time is which side of the ring we're on:

| Position | Perceives |
|----------|-----------|
| +B side of ring | Entropy increases toward +B direction |
| -B side of ring | Entropy increases toward -B direction |

Both directions are equally real. We perceive one because we ARE the +B partition. The ring creates structure in both directions simultaneously.

### Matter/Antimatter as Traversal Direction

```
+B direction: Creates structure → matter
-B direction: Undoes structure → antimatter

Annihilation = ring regions meeting
Energy released = traversal work stored in cloth
```

The matter/antimatter asymmetry is not mysterious — we ARE the +B partition, so we see "mostly matter." The -B partition sees "mostly antimatter." Neither view is privileged.

See [Machine Visualization](../foundations/machine/machine-visualization.md) for the complete model.

---

## Implications

### 1. No Creation Event

The universe was not "created."

The universe IS the logical structure that must exist (nothing is impossible).

### 2. No Final State

The universe does not "end."

The universe IS the eternal relation between +B and -B.

### 3. The Arrow of Time

Within +B, entropy increases (arrow of time).

This is not a cosmic law — it's our perspective as +B.

-B has the opposite arrow (from our view).

### 4. Conservation

What is conserved?

- Not energy (that's D-based, within +B)
- Not information in the usual sense

What is conserved:
- **B** — distinction itself
- **The structure** traverse(-B, B)
- **The constant L=2** between partitions

---

## Open Questions

### 1. Symmetry Breaking

If +B and -B are symmetric, why do we see matter dominance?

Answer: We ARE +B. From -B, they see antimatter dominance.

### 2. Information

Does information cross between +B and -B?

The constant L=2 connects them. Virtual pairs suggest brief crossing.

Macroscopic information crossing is unclear.

### 3. Multiple Partitions

Could B partition into more than two directions?

The theory suggests only +/- (forward/backward) is available.

But this deserves more investigation.

---

## Conclusion

```
The universe is not cyclic in time.
The universe is eternal in structure.

The structure is: traverse(-B, B) = existence

+B and -B perpetually compute.
They agree at every junction via constant L=2.
This agreement IS the present moment.
This structure IS existence.

There is no beginning. There is no end.
There is only the eternal traverse(-B, B).
```
