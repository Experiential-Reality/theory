# Cyclic Cosmology: The Eternal Structure

## Quick Summary (D≈7 Human Traversal)

**Eternal structure in 7 steps:**

1. **B exists** — Nothing is self-contradictory, so boundary must exist
2. **B partitions direction** — Creates +B (matter/forward) and -B (antimatter/backward)
3. **Connected by L=2** — Killing form constant links the partitions
4. **Both sides compute** — +B computes past→future, -B computes future→past
5. **Junction agreement** — At every "now," both computations must agree via L
6. **No temporal cycle** — Universe isn't cyclic in time, it's eternal in structure
7. **Time is perspective** — Big Bang and heat death are views within +B, not cosmic events

| Concept | BLD Interpretation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Big Bang | +B side of traverse(-B, B) |
| Heat death | Perspective within +B |
| Arrow of time | L-direction within our partition |
| Conservation | B, +B/-B partition, and L=2 persist eternally |

The universe is not cyclic in time. It is eternal in structure.

## The Claim

The universe does not "begin" or "end."

The universe IS the structure: `traverse(-B, B)` with constant L=2.

What we call "Big Bang" and "heat death" are perspectives on the same eternal structure.

---

## The Structure

### B Partitions Direction

From [Genesis Function](genesis-function.md):

```
B exists (nothing is impossible)
    ↓
B must partition (boundaries partition)
    ↓
Only direction available
    ↓
B partitions into +B and -B
    ↓
+B and -B must relate
    ↓
traverse(-B, B) requires L
    ↓
L = 2 (Killing form, constant)
```

### The Eternal Relation

The structure is:

```
-B <——L=2——> +B

Where:
  +B = our universe (matter, time-forward, left-handed)
  -B = anti-universe (antimatter, time-backward, right-handed)
  L  = 2 (constant connection, Killing form)
```

This is not a state that "arose." This IS existence.

### Both Sides Compute

From [Cosmic Computation](../quantum/cosmic-computation.md):

```
+B computes: past → present → future
-B computes: future → present → past

At every junction, both must agree via L.
```

---

## What "Cyclic" Means

### Not Temporal Cycles

The universe is not cyclic in the sense of:
- Big Bang → expansion → contraction → Big Bang
- One timeline looping back

### Structural Eternity

The universe is "cyclic" in the sense of:
- The structure `traverse(-B, B)` is self-sustaining
- +B and -B perpetually compute each other
- The junction consistency is eternal

```
It's not: Big Bang → heat death → Big Bang → ...
It's:     traverse(-B, B) = eternal structure
```

---

## The "Big Bang" and "Heat Death"

### From +B Perspective (Us)

Looking "backward" in time, we see:
- Structure becoming denser
- A "beginning" (Big Bang)

Looking "forward" in time, we see:
- Structure diluting
- An "end" (heat death)

### From -B Perspective

Looking in their "forward" direction (our backward):
- They see structure diluting toward their "heat death"

Looking in their "backward" direction (our forward):
- They see structure becoming denser, a "Big Bang"

### The Symmetry

```
What +B calls "Big Bang" is what -B calls approaching junction from their side
What +B calls "heat death" is what -B calls their "Big Bang" direction

Neither is privileged. Both are perspectives on traverse(-B, B).
```

---

## Time in the Structure

### Time is L-Direction

Time is not fundamental. Time is **L-direction** — which way you traverse the links.

```
+B: L flows past → future (our experience)
-B: L flows future → past (their experience)
```

### The Junction is "Now"

At the junction where +B and -B agree:
- This is the present moment
- Both computations describe the same state
- The future is constrained by this agreement

### No "Before" or "After"

There is no "before the Big Bang" because:
- The Big Bang is not an event in time
- The Big Bang IS the +B side of traverse(-B, B)
- Time is defined within +B, not outside it

---

## What Persists

### Not D, Not L-amount, But B

Within +B, matter (D) dilutes and geometry (L) stretches.

But:
- B (the distinction itself) persists
- The partition +B/-B persists
- The constant L=2 between them persists
- traverse(-B, B) persists

```
What changes: D and L within each partition
What persists: B, the partitions +B/-B, the constant L=2 between them
```

### The Eternal Present

From "outside" (if such a view were possible):

There is only the eternal structure traverse(-B, B).

The "flow of time" is our experience of being +B.

The "history of the universe" is the +B computation.

But the structure itself is not temporal. It simply IS.

## Comparison with Other Models

| Model | Mechanism | BLD Comparison |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Penrose CCC | Conformal rescaling | Different: no conformal tricks needed |
| Ekpyrotic | Brane collision | Different: no extra dimensions |
| Big Bounce | Quantum gravity | Different: no quantum gravity needed |
| Steady State | Continuous creation | Different: not creating in time |
| **BLD** | traverse(-B, B) eternal | Structure is existence itself |

### The BLD Insight

BLD doesn't say "the universe cycles through time."

BLD says "the universe IS the structure traverse(-B, B), which is eternal."

Time is not the arena. Time is the L-direction within +B.

---

## Implications

### 1. No Creation Event

The universe was not "created."

The universe IS the logical structure that must exist (nothing is impossible).

### 2. No Final State

The universe does not "end."

The universe IS the eternal relation between +B and -B.

### 3. The Arrow of Time

Within +B, entropy increases (arrow of time).

This is not a cosmic law — it's our perspective as +B.

-B has the opposite arrow (from our view).

### 4. Conservation

What is conserved?

- Not energy (that's D-based, within +B)
- Not information in the usual sense

What is conserved:
- **B** — distinction itself
- **The structure** traverse(-B, B)
- **The constant L=2** between partitions

---

## Open Questions

### 1. Symmetry Breaking

If +B and -B are symmetric, why do we see matter dominance?

Answer: We ARE +B. From -B, they see antimatter dominance.

### 2. Information

Does information cross between +B and -B?

The constant L=2 connects them. Virtual pairs suggest brief crossing.

Macroscopic information crossing is unclear.

### 3. Multiple Partitions

Could B partition into more than two directions?

The theory suggests only +/- (forward/backward) is available.

But this deserves more investigation.

## Summary

```
The universe is not cyclic in time.
The universe is eternal in structure.

The structure is: traverse(-B, B) = existence

+B and -B perpetually compute.
They agree at every junction via constant L=2.
This agreement IS the present moment.
This structure IS existence.

There is no beginning. There is no end.
There is only the eternal traverse(-B, B).
```
