## Key Results

| Quantity | Formula | Predicted | Observed | Source |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Dark matter | 5x = 25% + 2% correction | 27% | ~27% | [dark-matter-mapping.md](dark-matter-mapping.md) |
| Dark energy | 1 - 6x - 8x² | 68% | ~68% | [dark-matter-mapping.md](dark-matter-mapping.md) |

See [observer-correction.md](observer-correction.md) for the unified correction framework.

## Observer Correction Framework

All observed values follow:
```
Observed = Structural × (1 + 1/X)
```

Where X is a BLD structural constant (v, B, n×L, K).
