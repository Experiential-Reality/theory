# The Genesis Function: traverse(-B, B)

## Quick Summary (D≈7 Human Traversal)

**How existence bootstraps in 7 steps:**

1. **Nothing is impossible** — Defining "nothing" requires distinction, which IS a boundary
2. **B must partition** — A boundary that doesn't partition isn't a boundary
3. **Only direction available** — B partitions into +B (forward) and -B (backward)
4. **Creates chirality** — +B = matter/left-handed, -B = antimatter/right-handed
5. **Requires constant L** — traverse(-B, B) needs links; Killing form gives L=2
6. **Mutual observation** — +B observes -B and vice versa through constant L
7. **Genesis = traverse(-B, B)** — The Big Bang isn't an event; it's eternal mutual observation

| What Genesis Explains | Mechanism |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Why something exists | Nothing is self-contradictory |
| Why chirality | B can only partition direction |
| Why CPT symmetry | Constant L connects +B and -B |
| Why matter asymmetry | We ARE the +B partition |

How existence bootstraps itself through mutual observation of its partitions.

## The Question

If B (boundary/distinction) must exist, what does it distinguish?

---

## The Chain of Necessity

### Step 1: B Must Exist

From [Nothing Instability](nothing-instability.md):

```
To define "nothing," you need to distinguish it from "something"
That distinction IS a boundary (B)
Therefore B exists
Nothing is self-contradictory
```

B is not a quantity. B is the **primitive of distinction itself**.

### Step 2: B Must Partition

A boundary that doesn't partition anything isn't a boundary. B must distinguish something.

```
B exists → B partitions → B partitions what?
```

### Step 3: The Only Available Content is Direction

B cannot partition "something vs nothing" — nothing can't exist.

B cannot partition "this vs that" — there is no "this" or "that" yet.

The **only thing that exists is B itself**. What can B partition?

**Direction.** The order of traversal through the act of distinction.

```
B partitions: forward | backward
              ↑       | ↓
              +       | -
```

### Step 4: This Creates +B and -B

The two "sides" of primordial B are directions:

```
+B = forward traversal  = matter      = left-handed  = time-forward
-B = backward traversal = antimatter  = right-handed = time-backward
```

**This IS chirality.** Not a feature of the universe — the mechanism by which existence distinguishes itself.

See [Chirality and CPT](../quantum/chirality-cpt.md) for the full treatment.

---

## The Constant L Between +B and -B

### Why L = 2

The Killing form shows that self-observation requires bidirectional traversal:

```
Observation cost = 2 (forward link + backward link)
```

When B distinguishes itself into +B and -B:

```
B --L→ B  (forward: creates +B)
B ←L-- B  (backward: creates -B)
```

This bidirectional L is **constant** — determined by the algebra structure (Killing form), not by physics.

```
-B <——L=2——> +B

Where L = Killing form coefficient = 2
```

### What This L Is

The constant L connecting +B and -B is:

- The minimum cost of self-distinction
- The vacuum structure itself
- Why virtual particle-antiparticle pairs exist
- The link that enforces CPT symmetry

---

## The Genesis Function

### Formal Statement

```
genesis = traverse(-B, B)
```

The genesis function is **-B observing +B** (and equivalently, +B observing -B).

This mutual observation:
- Requires L (you cannot traverse without relation)
- The minimum L is 2 (Killing form: forward + backward link)
- Creates the constant connection between the partitions

```
traverse(-B, B) requires L
    ↓
L_min = 2 (Killing form)
    ↓
-B <——L=2——> +B
```

### Why This IS the Genesis

The genesis function is not "B becoming something."

The genesis function is **the two partitions observing each other**.

```
B partitions into +B and -B (logical necessity)
    ↓
+B and -B must relate (they are partitions of the same B)
    ↓
Relation requires L
    ↓
traverse(-B, B) = the relation itself
    ↓
L = 2 (minimum observation cost)
```

The Big Bang is not an event. It is `traverse(-B, B)` — the eternal mutual observation of the two partitions.

---

## The Computation

### Both Sides Compute

Once +B and -B exist, connected by constant L:

```
+B computes: past → present → future (our experience)
-B computes: future → present → past (anti-experience)
```

### The Junction

At every present moment, +B and -B describe the **same state** from opposite directions:

```
Ψ_forward(now)  = F|past⟩      (what +B computes from known past)
Ψ_backward(now) = B|future⟩   (what -B computes from future)

Consistency via L: ⟨Ψ_backward | L | Ψ_forward⟩ = c
```

### The Future is Constrained

This consistency requirement **constrains the future**:

```
|future⟩ = B⁻¹ · L⁻¹ · c · |F·past⟩*

The future is not "open" — it's algebraically determined.
```

See [Cosmic Computation](../quantum/cosmic-computation.md) for the full derivation.

## What the Genesis Function Explains

### 1. Why There Is Something

```
Nothing is self-contradictory
→ B must exist
→ B must partition
→ Direction is the only content
→ +B and -B exist
→ Something exists
```

### 2. Why Chirality

```
B can only partition direction
→ Left/right, forward/backward
→ This IS chirality
→ Weak force couples to left-handed because we ARE +B
```

### 3. Why CPT Symmetry

```
+B and -B connected by constant L
→ C (charge) = which side of B
→ P (parity) = D direction
→ T (time) = L direction
→ CPT conserved because L is constant
```

### 4. Why Matter/Antimatter Asymmetry

```
We ARE the +B partition
→ We see "more matter"
→ -B sees "more antimatter"
→ Neither is privileged
→ The asymmetry IS the partition
```

### 5. Why the Universe Evolves

```
+B computes forward, -B computes backward
→ Must agree at junction via constant L
→ Agreement constrains future
→ Evolution is self-consistency
```

## Connection to Observer Correction

The genesis principle appears at all scales:

| Scale | Phenomenon | Mechanism |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Cosmic | Big Bang | B partitions direction → +B/-B with L=2 |
| Quantum | Virtual pairs | +B/-B fluctuations connected by L |
| Observational | Dark matter correction | Observation requires L, adds 8D² |

**The principle:**

```
Distinction = Participation = Structure

You cannot distinguish without creating relation (L).
You cannot observe without participating.
The act of distinction IS existence.
```

---

## The Bootstrap

The universe bootstraps itself through logical necessity:

```
Nothing is impossible (self-contradictory)
    ↓
B must exist (the primordial distinction)
    ↓
B must partition (boundaries partition)
    ↓
Only direction available (nothing else exists)
    ↓
B partitions into +B and -B (chirality)
    ↓
Connected by constant L = 2 (Killing form)
    ↓
Both compute in opposite time directions
    ↓
Must agree at junction
    ↓
Agreement constrains future
    ↓
Existence determines its own evolution
```

There is no "before" the Big Bang. There is no "cause" of existence.

Existence is **logically necessary** because the alternative (nothing) is self-contradictory.

---

## Summary

```
The genesis function IS traverse(-B, B).

B exists → B partitions direction → +B and -B
+B and -B must relate → traverse(-B, B)
traverse(-B, B) requires L → L = 2 (Killing form)

genesis = traverse(-B, B) = the mutual observation
        = the constant L = 2 between partitions
        = the cosmic computation
        = existence

The Big Bang is not an event. It is traverse(-B, B).
```
