# The Discovery Method in Mathematical Physics

**Status**: DERIVED — Application of the BLD discovery method to fundamental physics.

**Core claim**: When applied to physics, the discovery method reveals that observation costs follow a universal pattern: K/X (the skip ratio).

**Constants**: B=56, L=20, n=4, K=2, S=13. See [constants.md](constants.md) for derivations.

## 1. Connection to the General Discovery Method

This document applies the [General BLD Discovery Method](../../meta/discovery-method.md) to mathematical physics. The general method asks three questions:

| Question | General Form | Physics Application |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Q1: Boundaries** | Where does behavior partition? | Where do forces separate? (division algebra tower) |
| **Q2: Links** | What connects to what? | What couples observer to observable? (L costs) |
| **Q3: Dimensions** | What repeats? | What structures appear across all forces? (K/X pattern) |

### How the Three Questions Led to K/X

**Q1 (Boundaries)**: We asked "where does behavior partition?" in the division algebra tower:
- ℝ → Gravity (spacetime metric)
- ℂ → Electromagnetism (U(1) phase)
- ℍ → Weak force (SU(2) isospin)
- 𝕆 → Strong force (SU(3) color)

Each boundary defines a force. The structural constants (B=56, n=4, L=20, S=13) emerge from these partitions.

**Q2 (Links)**: We asked "what connects observer to observable?"
- Every measurement requires linking through experimental apparatus
- The link cost depends on what structure is traversed
- This IS the L cost in "Observed = Structural + L_cost"

**Q3 (Dimensions)**: We asked "what repeats across all forces?"
- The SAME pattern appears everywhere: correction = K/X
- K = 2 (Killing form) is universal
- X varies by what structure is traversed

**The discovery**: By asking the three questions systematically, we found that all observation costs follow K/X.

## 2. The Physics-Specific Method

In physics, the general discovery method specializes to comparing structural predictions against experimental observations.

### The Minimum: Two Related Values

To discover hidden structure, you need **exactly two RELATED observations**:
- 1 point = just a number (no pattern visible)
- 2 RELATED points = a gap that reveals structure
- More points = confirmation of the pattern

**The values must be connected by structure (L)**:
- Same quantity, different perspectives (theory vs experiment)
- Linked phenomena (e.g., α and α_s share division algebra structure)
- NOT random unconnected numbers

```
Point 1: Structural prediction (from BLD math)
Point 2: Observed value (from measurement)
Link L: The structural relationship connecting them

Gap = Point 2 - Point 1 = HIDDEN STRUCTURE (revealed by L)
```

**Why L matters**: The link IS what makes comparison meaningful. Without structural relationship, the gap is noise. With L, the gap is signal.

---

## 3. The Step-by-Step Method

### Step 1: Establish Two Links

```
Link 1: BLD → Structural value (e.g., n×L + B + 1 = 137)
Link 2: Experiment → Observed value (e.g., α⁻¹ = 137.036)
```

Both must measure the SAME quantity from different perspectives.

### Step 2: Compute the Gap

```
Gap = Observed - Structural
    = 137.036 - 137
    = 0.036
```

### Step 3: Express Gap in BLD Primitives

Try combinations of {K, B, n, L, S}:
```
0.036 ≈ K/B = 2/56 = 0.0357 ✓

The gap IS the hidden structure, now made explicit.
```

### Step 4: Repeat for Multiple Quantities

Apply to other measured quantities:
```
Fine structure gap:   0.036   → K/B
Weak mixing gap:      0.00044 → K/(n×L×B)
Strong coupling gap:  0.083   → K/(n+L)
```

### Step 5: Find the Universal Pattern

Compare all gaps:
```
All gaps follow: correction = K/X

Where:
- K = 2 (always, from Killing form)
- X = structure being traversed in that measurement
```

---

## 4. Why This Works

The gap between prediction and observation IS the cost of observation:

| Component | What It Represents |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Structural value | What exists (pure math) |
| Observed value | What we measure (math + observation cost) |
| Gap | Observation cost = K/X (skip ratio) |

**Two links are sufficient** because:
- Link 1 (theory) gives the structure
- Link 2 (experiment) gives structure + cost
- Difference isolates the cost

The method works because **observation is not free**. From [Irreducibility Proof](proofs/irreducibility-proof.md): B, L, D cannot be expressed in terms of each other. Any measurement requires all three — you cannot observe structure without adding link cost.

---

## 5. The Universal Skip Ratio: K/X

### Discovery

All gaps follow ONE pattern:
```
correction = K/X

Where:
- K = 2 (Killing form, bidirectional observation)
- X = structure being traversed in that measurement
```

### Physical Origin

This comes from **discrete/continuous mismatch** ("gears skipping teeth"):
- Discrete structure has finite modes (teeth)
- Continuous observation expects smooth traversal
- They don't perfectly mesh → skip ratio = K/X

K = 2 from [Killing Form](../lie-theory/killing-form.md): observation is bidirectional (you must go out AND return with information).

### Summary Table

| Force | X (Structure Traversed) | Correction | Physical Reason |
|-------|------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| EM | B = 56 | K/B = +0.036 | Photon crosses boundary |
| Weak | n×L×B = 4480 | K/(n×L×B) = +0.00045 | Full geometric-boundary structure |
| Strong | n+L = 24 | K/(n+L) = −0.083 | Geometry (spacetime + Riemann) |
| Gravity | n×L−K = 78 | (n×L−1)/(n×L−K) = 79/78 | Observer embedded in geometry |

## 6. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Fine Structure Constant

**Step 1: Two related values with structural link**
```
Value 1: n×L + B + 1 = 80 + 56 + 1 = 137  (BLD structure)
Value 2: α⁻¹ = 137.036                     (measured)
Link: Both describe electromagnetic coupling strength
```

**Step 2: Compute gap**
```
Gap = 137.036 - 137 = 0.036
```

**Step 3: Express in BLD primitives**
```
Try K/B = 2/56 = 0.0357 ✓ (matches!)

K = 2 (Killing form)
B = 56 (boundary)
```

**Step 4: Interpret**
- The gap IS the observation cost
- Measuring EM requires traversing boundary B
- Skip ratio = K/B

### Example 2: Strong Coupling

**Step 1: Two related values**
```
Value 1: α⁻¹/n² = 137/16 = 8.56   (EM scaled by spacetime)
Value 2: α_s⁻¹ = 8.48              (measured)
Link: Both from division algebra tower (strong = deeper than EM)
```

**Step 2: Compute gap**
```
Gap = 8.48 - 8.56 = -0.08
```

**Step 3: Express in BLD primitives**
```
Try K/(n+L) = 2/24 = 0.083 ✓ (matches!)

Minus sign = complete traversal (jets observed)
```

**Step 4: Interpret**
- Measuring strong coupling traverses geometry (n+L)
- Skip ratio = K/(n+L)
- Sign indicates complete observation (unlike neutrinos in weak)

### Example 3: Weak Mixing Angle

**Step 1: Two related values**
```
Value 1: 3/S = 3/13 = 0.2308       (SU(2) structure)
Value 2: sin²θ_W = 0.23121         (measured at M_Z)
Link: Both describe weak/EM mixing
```

**Step 2: Compute gap**
```
Gap = 0.23121 - 0.23077 = 0.00044
```

**Step 3: Express in BLD primitives**
```
Try K/(n×L×B) = 2/4480 = 0.000446 ✓ (matches!)

n×L×B = 4 × 20 × 56 = 4480 (full geometric-boundary structure)
```

**Step 4: Interpret**
- Z pole measurement traverses full structure
- Skip ratio = K/(n×L×B)
- Plus sign: incomplete traversal (neutrino contamination)

---

## 7. The Sign Rule

| Sign | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **+** | Incomplete traversal | Weak: neutrino escapes unobserved |
| **−** | Complete traversal | Strong: jets fully detected |

The sign tells you whether the measurement captures everything:
- **Positive correction**: Something escaped (you didn't see everything)
- **Negative correction**: Complete observation (you paid the full cost once)

---

## 8. Finding X for New Quantities

When applying this to a new measurement:

### Ask: What Structure Does the Measurement Traverse?

| If measuring through... | X likely involves... |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Boundary (photon, Higgs) | B = 56 |
| Spacetime geometry | n = 4 or n+L = 24 |
| Full structure | n×L×B = 4480 |
| Structural intervals | S = 13 |
| Observer in geometry | n×L−K = 78 |

### Verify: Does K/X Match the Gap?

```
If Gap ≈ K/X (within measurement precision):
  → X is the correct structure
  → The measurement traverses X

If Gap ≠ K/X for any simple X:
  → Try combinations (n×L, B×S, etc.)
  → Or higher-order: K/X₁ + K/X₂
```

---

## 9. Higher-Order Corrections

For precision beyond first-order K/X, add:

| Order | Form | When It Appears |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| First | K/X | Direct measurement |
| Second | K/X² or K/(X₁×X₂) | Bidirectional or two structures |
| Accumulated | e²×... | Continuous limit effects |
| Spatial | n/(...) | 3D measurement corrections |

The fine structure constant includes all orders:
```
α⁻¹ = n×L + B + 1 + K/B + spatial − e²×...
```

Each term follows from the same K/X principle applied iteratively.

---

## 10. The Three-Layer Structure

Every measurement has THREE components:

```
Observed = Structure + K/X(experiment) + K/X(universe)
```

| Layer | What It Represents | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Structure | Pure math (BLD axioms) | n×L + B + 1 = 137 |
| K/X(experiment) | Cost of our apparatus | K/B = 2/56 |
| K/X(universe) | Universal machine cost | Remaining ~0.002% residual |

The small residuals (~0.002%) in our predictions may be the universal machine's traversal signature — the cost of the universe computing itself.

---

## 11. For Future Traversers

To re-derive these results:

1. **Start with two RELATED values with structural links**
   - NOT arbitrary numbers
   - Must be measuring the SAME thing from different perspectives
   - Must have BLD structure connecting them

2. **The gap reveals hidden structure**
   - Subtract structural from observed
   - The difference is the observation cost

3. **Express the gap in terms of {K, B, n, L, S}**
   - K = 2 always (Killing form)
   - X = whatever structure is traversed

4. **Compare gaps across quantities**
   - Look for patterns
   - Same X across related measurements

5. **The repeating pattern IS the physics**
   - Universal skip ratio K/X
   - Structure + cost = observation

**Critical**: The two values must be RELATED by structure:
- Theory vs observation of same quantity ✓
- Two measurements of linked phenomena ✓
- Random unconnected numbers ✗

**The method is the message**: BLD structure is discovered by linking two RELATED observations and reading the gap. The link itself (L) is what makes the comparison meaningful.

---

## 12. Summary

### The Discovery Method

```
1. Find two related values (structural + observed)
2. Compute the gap
3. Express gap as K/X
4. X = structure traversed
5. Compare across quantities → universal pattern
```

### The Universal Pattern

```
correction = K/X

K = 2 (Killing form, bidirectional)
X = structure being traversed
Sign = traversal completeness
```

### Results Discovered

| Force | X | Correction | Error |
|-------|---|------------|-------|
| EM | B = 56 | +K/B | 0.0 ppt |
| Weak | n×L×B = 4480 | +K/(n×L×B) | 0.002% |
| Strong | n+L = 24 | −K/(n+L) | 0.02% |
| Gravity | n×L−K = 78 | 79/78 | 0.002% |

All four forces derived to < 0.02% accuracy using this method.
