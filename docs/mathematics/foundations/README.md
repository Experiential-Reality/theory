## Reading Order

1. **Start**: `bld-calculus.md` — definitions of B, L, D
2. **Then**: `irreducibility-proof.md` — why all three are needed
3. **Then**: `irreducibility-categorical.md` — formal proof
4. **Then**: `completeness-proof.md` — why three is enough
5. **Then**: `why-exactly-three.md` — why no fourth exists
6. **Finally**: `octonion-derivation.md` — connection to division algebras and physics

## Key Results

- **B, L, D are irreducible**: None can express another (proven)
- **B, L, D are complete**: Sufficient for all observable structure (proven)
- **Three is both minimal and maximal**: Complete structural basis
- **BLD requires octonions**: For bidirectional observation with SU(3) matter
- **L compensates B**: Links can approximate boundaries, not vice versa (proven)
- **All four forces derived**: From division algebra tower + experimental L costs (derived)
- **Energy derived**: E = K × Σ(1/Xᵢ) = observation scope (derived)
