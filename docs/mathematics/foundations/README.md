## Reading Order

### Path 1: Core Theory (Required)
1. **Start**: `bld-calculus.md` — definitions of B, L, D
2. **Then**: `irreducibility-proof.md` — why all three are needed
3. **Then**: `irreducibility-categorical.md` — formal categorical proof
4. **Then**: `completeness-proof.md` — why three is enough
5. **Then**: `why-exactly-three.md` — why no fourth exists
6. **Then**: `categorical-correspondence.md` — BLD = Category Theory

### Path 2: Physics Connection (After Path 1)
7. **Start**: `octonion-derivation.md` — division algebras → n=4, SU(3), 3 gen
8. **Then**: `octonion-necessity.md` — why octonions are REQUIRED (closure argument)
9. **Then**: `force-structure.md` — all four forces from K/X

### Path 3: Structural Principles (After Path 2)
10. `compensation-principle.md` — L compensates B
11. `energy-derivation.md` — E = K × Σ(1/Xᵢ)
12. `discovery-method.md` — the Q1/Q2/Q3 methodology

### Path 4: The Universal Machine (Advanced)
13. `universal-machine.md` — traverse(-B, B) as computation
14. `detection-structure.md` — the T ∩ S formalism
15. `integer-machine.md` — boundary-based computation
16. `machine-visualization.md` — Ring and Cloth model
17. `ubit.md` — the universal bit

## Key Results

- **B, L, D are irreducible**: None can express another (proven)
- **B, L, D are complete**: Sufficient for all observable structure (proven)
- **Three is both minimal and maximal**: Complete structural basis
- **BLD = Category Theory**: B=coproduct, L=morphism, D=product (derived)
- **BLD requires octonions**: Genesis closure requires B=56 modes (derived)
- **SU(3) is derived**: From octonion necessity, not observed (derived)
- **L compensates B**: Links can approximate boundaries, not vice versa (proven)
- **All four forces derived**: From division algebra tower + K/X costs (derived)
- **Energy derived**: E = K × Σ(1/Xᵢ) = observation scope (derived)
- **Cascade ratio λ = 1/√20**: From S₃ cascade (Catalan C₃=5), see [scale-derivation.md](../cosmology/scale-derivation.md)
- **Universe is a machine**: traverse(-B, B) = cosmic computation (derived)
