## The Mapping

| BLD | Lie Theory | Status |
|-----|------------|--------|
| D (Dimension) | Generator | PROVEN |
| L (Link) | Structure constant fᵢⱼᵏ | PROVEN |
| B (Boundary) | Group topology | PROVEN |

## Key Results

- **Complete correspondence**: No residue on either side
- **Killing form K = 2**: Bidirectional observation cost
- **150 years of Lie theory transfers to BLD**

## Reading Order

1. **Start**: `lie-correspondence.md` — the exact mapping
2. **Then**: `killing-form.md` — where 2 comes from
3. **Optional**: `why-lie-theory.md` — non-technical explanation
