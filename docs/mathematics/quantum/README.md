## Reading Order

1. **Start**: `quantum-mechanics.md` — position (D) and momentum (L) mapping
2. **Then**: `born-rule.md` — why probability is |amplitude|²
3. **Then**: `structural-observer-framework.md` — observer correction algebra
4. **Finally**: `planck-derivation.md` — ℏ from structural constants

## Open Questions

- ~~Collapse ontology~~: RESOLVED — collapse is structural (L→B compensation). See [wave-function-collapse.md](wave-function-collapse.md)
- **Path integrals**: [Derived](path-integral.md) — D(L(B)) applied to time evolution
