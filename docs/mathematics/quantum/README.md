## Reading Order

1. **Start**: `quantum-mechanics.md` — position (D) and momentum (L) mapping
2. **Then**: `born-rule.md` — why probability is |amplitude|²
3. **Then**: `structural-observer-framework.md` — observer correction algebra
4. **Finally**: `planck-derivation.md` — ℏ from structural constants

## Open Questions

- **Measurement collapse**: Why specific outcome? (documented as OPEN)
- **Path integrals**: Not covered (future work)
