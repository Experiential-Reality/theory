# Quantum Mechanics in BLD

Uncertainty principle follows from D-L irreducibility and Lie algebra structure.

## Status Legend

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[PROVEN]` | Follows from established BLD/Lie theory |
| `[DERIVED]` | Logical consequence of proven statements |
| `[POSTULATED]` | Assumed without full derivation |

## Scope Note

This document derives the **uncertainty principle** from BLD. It does NOT derive:
- The Schrödinger equation
- Wave function collapse
- The Born rule
- Path integrals

These remain as future work.

---

## The Core Claim `[DERIVED]`

Position and momentum are different **BLD types**:
- Position (x): **D-type** — location in dimensional space
- Momentum (p): **L-type** — how positions link across time

Their coupling [x, p] = iℏ is a **structure constant** in the Lie algebra of phase space.

**The uncertainty principle is not a postulate.** It is a geometric constraint arising from the non-commutativity of irreducible primitives.

---

## Position and Momentum

### Position: D-Type

Position answers: **"Where?"**

```
D position: x [location]
  # A point in dimensional space
  # "Here, not there"
  # Specifies a coordinate along an axis
```

Position is D-type because:
- It is an axis of extension (dimension)
- It can be repeated (many positions along the axis)
- It is independent of connections between positions

### Momentum: L-Type

Momentum answers: **"How does position change?"**

```
L momentum: p = m × dx/dt [velocity_link]
  # How position links across time
  # "From here to there, at this rate"
  # The connection between position_now and position_later
```

Momentum is L-type because:
- It relates positions across time (a link)
- It is directional (source → target)
- It cannot exist without positions to connect

### The Coupling: Structure Constant

The commutation relation:

```
[x̂, p̂] = iℏ
```

In Lie algebra terms:

```
[X_i, X_j] = f^k_ij X_k

Where:
  X_i, X_j = generators (D)
  f^k_ij = structure constants (L)

For position-momentum:
  [x̂, p̂] = iℏ·Î

  The structure constant is iℏ
```

**The commutator IS the link.** The fact that [x, p] ≠ 0 means position and momentum are **coupled** by a non-zero structure constant.

---

## The Uncertainty Principle `[DERIVED]`

### From Commutator to Uncertainty

The Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty relation:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ |⟨[x̂, p̂]⟩| / 2 = ℏ/2
```

This follows mathematically from the commutator structure. `[PROVEN in standard QM]`

**BLD contribution**: Interpreting [x,p]=iℏ as structure constant between D-type (x) and L-type (p) primitives.

### BLD Derivation

```
Step 1: Position (D) and momentum (L) are irreducible primitives
        - Proven in irreducibility-proof.md
        - Neither is expressible in terms of the other

Step 2: They are coupled by non-zero structure constant [x, p] = iℏ
        - This is the L (link) between them
        - The coupling is geometric, not arbitrary

Step 3: Non-zero structure constant → non-abelian algebra
        - Abelian: [A, B] = 0 → observables commute → can know both
        - Non-abelian: [A, B] ≠ 0 → observables don't commute → trade-off

Step 4: Non-abelian algebra → curved phase space
        - Flat space: parallel transport is path-independent
        - Curved space: parallel transport depends on path
        - The curvature comes from the structure constants

Step 5: Curved space → geodesic constraints
        - You cannot move arbitrarily in both directions
        - Precision in one constrains precision in the other
        - Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2 is the minimum geodesic constraint
```

### Why You Can't Beat It

The uncertainty principle is **structural**, not practical:

| Interpretation | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| "Measurement disturbs system" | True, but even perfect measurement has ℏ/2 limit |
| "We lack technology" | No technology can overcome geometric constraints |
| "Hidden variables" | Bell's theorem rules this out |

**The real reason:** D and L are irreducible primitives. You cannot fully specify one without affecting the other when they are coupled by a non-zero structure constant.

This is like asking: "Can I know both the radius and circumference of a circle to arbitrary precision independently?"

No — they are coupled by C = 2πr. Specifying one determines the other. The coupling is geometric, not practical.

## The Killing Form Connection

### Observation Costs 2 Links

From [killing-form.md](../lie-theory/killing-form.md):

```
B(X, X) = 2  (for SO(3,1))

Observation requires:
  - Forward link: query from observer to observed
  - Backward link: response from observed to observer

Minimum cost = 2 links (Killing form coefficient)
```

### The Factor of 2 in Uncertainty

The uncertainty principle has a factor of 2:

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2
```

This "2" is the **Killing form coefficient**:

```
Robertson relation: Δx · Δp ≥ |⟨[x̂, p̂]⟩| / 2
                             = |iℏ| / 2
                             = ℏ / 2

The "2" comes from:
  - Mathematical: Robertson inequality derivation
  - Physical: Bidirectional observation (Killing form = 2)
```

**Hypothesis**: The factor of 2 in uncertainty is the same "2" that appears in:
- Killing form diagonal entries (±2)
- Observer correction denominator (2/(n×L))
- Cosmology correction (8x² = 2 × n × x²)

All are manifestations of bidirectional observation cost.

## Quantization from Compact Boundaries

### Compact B → Discrete Spectrum

From [lie-correspondence.md](../lie-theory/lie-correspondence.md):

```
Compact group → closed orbits → periodic → quantized eigenvalues
Non-compact group → open orbits → unbounded → continuous spectrum
```

| Group | Compactness | Spectrum | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| SO(3) | Compact | Discrete | Angular momentum L = 0, 1, 2, ... |
| SU(2) | Compact | Discrete | Spin s = 0, ½, 1, 3/2, ... |
| U(1) | Compact | Discrete | Charge Q = ne |
| SO(3,1) boosts | Non-compact | Continuous | Rapidity η ∈ ℝ |
| Translations | Non-compact | Continuous | Position x ∈ ℝ |

### BLD Interpretation

```
B compact: closed
  # Orbits return to start
  # Periodicity forces quantization
  # Eigenvalues are discrete

B non_compact: open
  # Orbits escape to infinity
  # No periodicity constraint
  # Eigenvalues are continuous
```

**Quantization is a boundary phenomenon.** The topology (B) of the symmetry group determines whether the spectrum is discrete or continuous.

## Phase Space Structure

### The Heisenberg Algebra

Position and momentum form the Heisenberg algebra:

```
[x̂, p̂] = iℏ
[x̂, Î] = 0
[p̂, Î] = 0
```

In BLD terms:

```
D x: position [coordinate]
L p: momentum [temporal_link]
B phase_space: x_known | p_known | neither_known
  # You choose which to specify precisely
  # The boundary partitions possible states
```

### Minimum Phase Space Cell

```
Δx · Δp ≥ ℏ/2

The minimum phase space area = ℏ/2
This is the "quantum of action"
```

In BLD terms:

```
D × L ≥ ℏ/2

The product of D-precision and L-precision is bounded below.
This is D-L irreducibility manifested as minimum area.
```

## Connection to Observer Corrections

### The Pattern Across Scales

| Scale | Observer Correction | The "2" |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Cosmology | 8x² = 2 × n × x² | Killing form × dimensions |
| Particle physics | 2/(n×L) = 2/80 | Killing form / structure |
| Quantum mechanics | ℏ/2 | Killing form in Robertson bound |

All three involve the Killing form coefficient (2) because observation is inherently bidirectional.

### Why Quantum is Different

| Domain | Type of Correction |
|--------|-------------------|
| Cosmology | Additive (you ADD L by measuring) |
| Particle physics | Fractional (you USE part of structure to measure) |
| Quantum | Multiplicative bound (you can't go below ℏ/2) |

Quantum uncertainty is a **lower bound**, not an additive correction. You don't "add" uncertainty; you can't avoid it.

---

## Implications

### 1. Uncertainty is Geometric

The uncertainty principle is not about:
- Measurement apparatus limitations
- Observer disturbance
- Lack of knowledge

It is about the **geometry of phase space**. Position and momentum are different types of structure (D and L) coupled by a non-zero link (structure constant iℏ).

### 2. You Can Trade, Not Eliminate

You can know position precisely (Δx → 0) if you accept Δp → ∞.
You can know momentum precisely (Δp → 0) if you accept Δx → ∞.

You cannot eliminate uncertainty. You can only choose where to allocate it.

### 3. Quantum Computing Routes Around It

See [quantum-computing.md](quantum-computing.md):

Instead of measuring (paying L-cost) → structure computes as structure.
Entanglement provides pre-established L without measurement.
You defer the uncertainty cost until final readout.
