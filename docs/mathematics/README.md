## Foundations

Core mathematical definitions and proofs.

- [BLD Calculus](./foundations/bld-calculus.md) — Formal type system for B/L/D
- [Irreducibility Proof](./foundations/irreducibility-proof.md) — B/L/D are minimal primitives
- [Irreducibility (Categorical)](./foundations/irreducibility-categorical.md) — Type-theoretic proof
- [Canonical Hardness](./foundations/canonical-hardness.md) — Finding minimal BLD is NP-complete
