# Structural Geometry

**Layer 1-2**: The structural manifold — a geometric space where:
- **Points** = BLD configurations (B, L, D)
- **Distance** = Alignment cost between structures
- **Geodesics** = Optimal transformation paths

This manifold contains classical Information Geometry as a submanifold, connects to Lie theory via symmetric space structure, and enables prediction of system behavior from structure alone.
