# BLD Analysis

Documentation analysis and consistency checking.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [math-verification-report.md](math-verification-report.md) | External verification of physics constants, Lie theory, quarks, bosons, novel predictions |
| [error-analysis.md](error-analysis.md) | Analysis of BLD errors vs experimental uncertainty, including cosmological K/X examples |

## Purpose

This directory contains meta-analysis of the BLD documentation:
- External verification against CODATA 2022 / PDG 2024
- Error source analysis (measurement vs K/X observer correction)
- Tracking novel predictions (muon g-2, Higgs κ_λ)
- Documenting derived constants (Feigenbaum, Reynolds)
