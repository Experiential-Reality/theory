# Meta: Governance and Methodology

This directory contains documents about **how BLD theory is developed and maintained** — not the theory itself.

## Contents

### Governance

- [Epistemic Honesty](epistemic-honesty.md) — Standards for distinguishing what is proven vs. hypothesized
- [Proof Status](proof-status.md) — Current accounting of what is proven, validated, derived, and conjectured

### Methodology

- [Discovery Method](discovery-method.md) — How to find BLD structure in any system
- [Research Directions](research-directions.md) — Open problems and active research

### History

- [Discovery History](discovery-history.md) — From JPEG decoder to fundamental physics: the actual discovery journey vs logical reconstruction

## Status Categories

BLD uses four epistemic categories:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **PROVEN** | Follows from established mathematics (type theory, Lie theory) |
| **DERIVED** | Logical consequence of proven statements |
| **EMPIRICAL** | Matches experimental data within error bounds |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Plausibility argument, not proof |

See [Proof Status](proof-status.md) for the current status of each claim.
