# Meta: Governance and Methodology

This directory contains documents about **how BLD theory is developed and maintained** — not the theory itself.

- [Research Directions](research-directions.md) — Open problems and active research

### History

- [Discovery History](discovery-history.md) — From JPEG decoder to fundamental physics: the actual discovery journey vs logical reconstruction
- [Discovery Path](discovery-path.md) — The full journey from GPU kernels to BLD

### Algorithms and Comparisons

- [Discovery Algorithm](discovery-algorithm.md) — Formal algorithm for finding BLD structure
- [Validation Roadmap](validation-roadmap.md) — Experimental validation tracking
- [Comparisons](comparisons.md) — BLD vs Roofline, Fisher-Rao, circuit complexity

## Status Categories

BLD uses four epistemic categories:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **PROVEN** | Follows from established mathematics (type theory, Lie theory) |
| **DERIVED** | Logical consequence of proven statements |
| **EMPIRICAL** | Matches experimental data within error bounds |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Plausibility argument, not proof |

See [Proof Status](proof-status.md) for the current status of each claim.
