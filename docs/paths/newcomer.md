# Reading Path: Newcomer

> **Status**: Foundational

> Start here if you're new to BLD.

This path introduces the core concepts in ~30 minutes of reading.

## Quick Summary (D≈7 Human Traversal)

**Newcomer reading path in 7 steps:**

1. **Core Thesis** — Understand the big picture: structure is substrate-independent, and BLD maps to Lie theory
2. **Structural Language** — Learn the three primitives: B (Boundary), L (Link), D (Dimension)
3. **Irreducibility Proof** — See why exactly three primitives: B, L, D are independent and minimal
4. **Lie Theory Connection** — Understand why BLD works: it's Lie theory in structural form
5. **Choose Your Path** — Branch to Mathematician (rigor), Practitioner (applications), or Discovery Method
6. **Euler Unification** — Optional deep dive into how e and π unify the compensation mechanisms
7. **Quick Reference** — Use the cost formula and primitive-to-Lie mapping as mental tools

## Step 1: The Big Picture

**Read**: [Core Thesis](../theory/README.md)

**Key takeaway**: Structure is substrate-independent. The same three primitives (B, L, D) appear everywhere because they map to Lie theory.

---

## Step 2: The Three Primitives

**Read**: [Structural Language](../theory/structural-language.md)

**Key takeaway**:
- **B** (Boundary) = where behavior partitions
- **L** (Link) = what connects to what
- **D** (Dimension) = what repeats

---

## Step 3: Why Exactly Three?

**Read**: [Irreducibility Proof](../mathematics/foundations/proofs/irreducibility-proof.md)

**Key takeaway**: B, L, D are independent primitives—you can't derive one from the others. Three is the minimum.

---

## Step 4: Why It Works

**Read**: [Why Lie Theory](../mathematics/lie-theory/why-lie-theory.md)

**Key takeaway**: BLD = Lie theory. This explains why the same patterns appear in physics, computing, and biology.

## What's Next?

After this path, you can:

- **Go deeper into math**: [Mathematician Path](./mathematician.md)
- **See it applied**: [Practitioner Path](./practitioner.md)
- **Try it yourself**: [Discovery Method](../meta/discovery-method.md)

### Advanced Topic: The Euler Unification

Once you understand B/L/D, explore how they unify through Euler's formula:

**Read**: [Euler's Formula in BLD](../glossary.md#euler) and [π from BLD](../examples/pi-from-bld.md)

**Key takeaway**: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 connects the two compensation mechanisms:
- **e** (exponential) — cascades, depth, gain stacking
- **π** (angular) — rotations, phases, closure at 2π

The α-helix in proteins uses both simultaneously: e^(a+iθ) = rise + rotation.

## Quick Reference

| Primitive | Question | Lie Equivalent |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **B** | Where does behavior partition? | Group topology |
| **L** | What connects to what? | Structure constants |
| **D** | What repeats? | Generators |

```
Cost = B_cost + D × L_cost
```
