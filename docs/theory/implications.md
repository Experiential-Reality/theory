# Implications

If this framework is correct:

1. **Structure is substrate-independent**: The same structural laws govern silicon, proteins, markets, and minds.

2. **Cost is alignment**: Performance, energy, fitness, likelihood—all manifestations of structural alignment.

3. **Complexity is structural**: P vs NP is a statement about what traversers physics permits, not about cleverness of algorithms.

4. **Physics is a traverser**: The laws of physics are the traverser structure that reality uses to process configurations.

5. **Experience is alignment**: What it feels like to be a structure aligning with itself and its environment.

6. **Thermodynamics is geometric**: The second law is not a postulate—it's a theorem about manifold exploration. Entropy is the log of accessible structural volume. See [Thermodynamics](../mathematics/derived/thermodynamics.md).
