# BLD MAPPING
# =============================================================================
#
# | BLD | Protein | Examples |
# |-----|---------|----------|
# | B | Conformational boundaries | Disorder regions, switches |
# | L | Contacts | H-bonds, hydrophobic, disulfide |
# | D | Residue count | Chain length |

B conformation: folded | unfolded | misfolded
  folded -> native_state, functional
  unfolded -> disordered
  misfolded -> alternative_minimum, pathogenic

# =============================================================================
# LEVINTHAL PARADOX RESOLUTION
# =============================================================================
#
# Paradox: Proteins fold in milliseconds despite astronomical conformations.
#
# BLD Resolution: Speed comes from locality of alignment.
#   Folding = gradient descent on alignment landscape
#   NOT exhaustive search through conformations
#
# Each step follows local alignment gradient:
#   1. Hydrophobic collapse (L: hydrophobic contacts)
#   2. Secondary structure formation (L: H-bonds)
#   3. Tertiary packing (B: steric boundaries)

L h_bond: donor -> acceptor (energy=-2_to_-7_kcal_mol)
L hydrophobic: nonpolar_i -> nonpolar_j (burial_energy=varies)

# =============================================================================
# THE PRION PROBLEM
# =============================================================================
#
# Question: Why does the same sequence fold two different ways?
#
# PrP^C (Native):
#   Structure: α-helix dominated
#   Alignment: Optimized for aqueous physics
#
# PrP^Sc (Pathogenic):
#   Structure: β-sheet dominated
#   Alignment: Alternative minimum
#
# BLD Explanation: Two traversers
#   1. Water physics: Favors helix (PrP^C)
#   2. Template (PrP^Sc): Different alignment landscape
#
# Template conversion:
#   PrP^Sc acts as second traverser
#   Lowers barrier between minima
#   This is why prions are "infectious"

D residues: N [sequential]

# =============================================================================
# EULER'S FORMULA IN PROTEINS
# =============================================================================
#
# α-helix structure demonstrates e^(a+iθ):
#   - 3.6 residues per turn (angular: π/θ)
#   - Exponential hydrogen bond strength (e^a)
#   - Spiral = simultaneous rotation and scaling
#
# This validates both compensation mechanisms in one structure.
