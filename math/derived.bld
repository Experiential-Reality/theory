# MANIFOLD STRUCTURE
# =============================================================================
#
# BLD structures form a stratified manifold:
#   - Points = structures
#   - Distance = alignment cost
#   - Metric = Hessian of cost function
#
# Properties:
#   - Locally Euclidean in each stratum
#   - Strata boundaries = structural phase transitions
#   - Geodesics = optimal alignment paths

B stratum: same_BLD_type | different_BLD_type
  same_BLD_type -> smooth_transition
  different_BLD_type -> boundary_crossing, structural_change

# BOUNDARY COST DERIVATION
# =============================================================================
#
# B cost derived from SPD(d) curvature (information geometry):
#
# For d-dimensional symmetric positive definite matrices:
#   B_cost = Tr(log²(Σ₁⁻¹/²Σ₂Σ₁⁻¹/²)) / (d log² condition_ratio)
#
# This is the Fisher-Rao geodesic distance, normalized.
#
# Key insight:
#   - B measures "how different are the modes?"
#   - Topological difference = geodesic distance in SPD space
#   - Cost independent of dimension d (B is topological)

# THERMODYNAMICS DERIVATION
# =============================================================================
#
# Second Law from BLD alignment:
#
# Given:
#   - Structure S (system state)
#   - Traverser T (environment/physics)
#   - Alignment cost C(S, T)
#
# Dynamics:
#   dS/dt = -∇C (gradient descent on cost)
#
# Therefore:
#   dC/dt = -|∇C|² ≤ 0
#
# Cost always decreases → Second Law.
#
# Entropy production = alignment cost rate:
#   dS/dt = k_B T × C_rate ≥ 0
#
# Validated: 10/10 tests pass.

# CONSERVATION (NOETHER'S THEOREM IN BLD)
# =============================================================================
#
# If structure S has symmetry group G:
#   - G preserves BLD → conserved quantity
#   - Translation symmetry → momentum conservation
#   - Rotation symmetry → angular momentum conservation
#   - Time symmetry → energy conservation
#
# BLD symmetries = Lie group actions.
# Conserved quantities = generators of the symmetry group.
