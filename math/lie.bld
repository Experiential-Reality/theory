# lie.bld - Lie Theory Correspondence
#
# THE KEY RESULT: BLD = Lie Theory

structure LieTheory

# =============================================================================
# THE CORRESPONDENCE
# =============================================================================
#
# BLD primitives map EXACTLY to Lie algebra components:
#
# | BLD | Lie Theory | Mathematical Object |
# |-----|------------|---------------------|
# | D | Generators | Basis elements Xᵢ |
# | L | Structure constants | fᵢⱼᵏ in [Xᵢ, Xⱼ] = fᵢⱼᵏXₖ |
# | B | Group topology | Compact vs non-compact |
#
# This is not analogy. It is MATHEMATICAL EQUIVALENCE.

B correspondence: generators | structure_constants | topology
  generators -> D_dimension, basis_elements
  structure_constants -> L_links, commutator_coefficients
  topology -> B_boundaries, compactness

# =============================================================================
# WHY THIS WORKS
# =============================================================================
#
# Lie Theory (1870s) solves: "What are the continuous symmetries?"
# BLD answers: "What structure exists in any system?"
#
# They arrive at the same primitives because:
#   - Symmetry IS structure preservation
#   - Structure preservation requires B/L/D
#   - Continuous symmetries form Lie groups
#   - Lie groups have exactly D/L/B components
#
# The dimension formula:
#   dim(g) = |generators| + structure_complexity
#   Cost = B + D × L
#
# These are the SAME formula in different notation.

# =============================================================================
# ALIGNMENT AS LIE HOMOMORPHISM
# =============================================================================
#
# When two structures align:
#   φ: g₁ → g₂
#
# Requirements:
#   - Preserves generators (D): φ(Xᵢ) maps to generators
#   - Preserves structure constants (L): φ([X,Y]) = [φ(X), φ(Y)]
#   - Preserves topology (B): compact → compact
#
# Alignment cost = distance from homomorphism.
# Perfect alignment = exact homomorphism.

L homomorphism: structure_a -> structure_b (preserves=B_L_D)

D generators: n [parallel]

# =============================================================================
# IMPLICATIONS
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. Classification theorems apply
#    All simple Lie algebras are classified.
#    Therefore all "simple" BLD structures are classifiable.
#
# 2. Representation theory applies
#    Lie representations map to BLD traversals.
#    Irreducible representations = minimal traversers.
#
# 3. Exceptional structures exist
#    E₆, E₇, E₈ Lie algebras have no continuous family.
#    What do they correspond to in BLD? (Open question)
