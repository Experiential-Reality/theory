# IRREDUCIBILITY PROOF
# =============================================================================
#
# Claim: B, L, D are independent primitives.
#
# Proof by witness structures:
#
# B without L/D:
#   S = { {}, {a} }
#   Two partitions, no references, no repetition.
#   Pure boundary.
#
# L without B/D:
#   S = { a → b }
#   One reference, no partition, no repetition.
#   Pure link.
#
# D without B/L:
#   S = [a, a, a]
#   Three copies, no partition, no reference.
#   Pure dimension.
#
# Each primitive can exist independently.
# Therefore B, L, D are irreducible.

B primitive: boundary | link | dimension
  boundary -> partition_witness
  link -> reference_witness
  dimension -> repetition_witness

# BLD CALCULUS (Type System)
# =============================================================================
#
# Types:
#   B : Type → Type  (partition function)
#   L : Type → Type → Type  (connection)
#   D : Type → Nat → Type  (repetition)
#
# Formation rules:
#   B(T) = partition of values of type T
#   L(S, T) = directed edge from S to T
#   D(T, n) = n homogeneous copies of T
#
# Cost typing:
#   Cost(B(T)) = |partitions|
#   Cost(L(S, T)) = -½ ln(1 - ρ²)
#   Cost(D(T, n)) = n × Cost(T)

L type_check: structure -> (B, L, D) (deps=1)

# =============================================================================
# CANONICAL HARDNESS
# =============================================================================
#
# Claim: Finding the minimal BLD representation is NP-complete.
#
# Reduction from graph coloring:
#   - Graph nodes → structure elements
#   - Graph edges → required distinctions
#   - Chromatic number → minimal B
#
# This means:
#   - There's no polynomial algorithm for optimal BLD
#   - Heuristics are necessary in practice
#   - BLD predicts its own computational hardness
