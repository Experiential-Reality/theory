#   2. Lie Theory: The BLD = Lie correspondence
#   3. Derived: Manifold structure, thermodynamics

# KEY THEOREMS
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. IRREDUCIBILITY THEOREM
#    B, L, D are independent primitives.
#    Proof: Witness structures for each.
#
# 2. LIE CORRESPONDENCE THEOREM
#    BLD = Lie Theory (exact equivalence)
#    D ↔ Generators, L ↔ Structure constants, B ↔ Topology
#
# 3. L FORMULA THEOREM
#    L = -½ ln(1 - ρ²) (exact, from KL divergence)
#
# 4. COMPENSATION THEOREM
#    L can compensate for B, not vice versa.
#    Proof: B is topological, L is geometric.
#
# 5. CANONICAL HARDNESS THEOREM
#    Finding minimal BLD is NP-complete.
#    (As predicted by BLD itself!)
#
# 6. CONSERVATION THEOREM
#    Noether's theorem in BLD.
#    Symmetries preserve BLD structure.
#
# 7. THERMODYNAMICS THEOREM
#    Second Law derived from alignment dynamics.
#    dS/dt ≥ 0 (validated, 10/10 tests)
